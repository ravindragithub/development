Any Unacceptable Use of the Airtime Services shall be a breach of this Agreement.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="Numbered-Underline">Airtime Services Limitations.
            <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Subscriber is responsible for abiding by all international and jurisdictional rules and regulations. The Airtime Services may be used in international waters and to the extent permitted, within the territorial waters of various countries. Subscriber is responsible for ensuring that the Services are used only within the territorial waters of countries that permit such use. Subscriber acknowledges that the definition and geographic size of territorial waters for purposes of these limitations varies from country to country. Subscriber also acknowledges that some countries such as the United States permit the unlimited use of the Airtime Services in their territorial waters, while others may allow use of the Airtime Services only on a temporary basis while transiting their waters and others may not allow use of the Airtime Services in their territorial waters at all. The current status of the authority to operate the Airtime Services in individual countries is listed at <a href="http://www.kvh.com/licenses"><span class="Hyperlink">www.kvh.com/licenses</span></a>, which status is subject to change from time to time. This list is provided for convenience only and is non-binding on KVH, and KVH has no obligation to update the same.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="Numbered-Underline">KVH Status.
            <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Subscriber acknowledges that KVH makes the Airtime Services available using satellite and telecommunications networks, programming Content, and other services provided to KVH by third party Service Providers. The networks and Content vary with regard to technology, configuration, Terminal Equipment, and/or Subscriber Equipment to be used and with regard to application possibilities. An Airtime Service can only be used in relation to the network of the applicable Service Provider. KVH’s ability to make the Airtime Services available is therefore derived from and limited by the terms of the agreements between KVH and the Service Providers. KVH will at all times have the right to take measures and/or give instructions to Subscriber that KVH or its Service Providers deem reasonably necessary in order to prevent and/or correct faults in the Airtime Services, which Subscriber shall follow. KVH also has no control and no responsibility or liability over the manner in which Airtime Services are delivered and provided by Service Providers. The Airtime Services and this Agreement will automatically terminate if KVH’s agreements with applicable Service Providers terminate, or if KVH ceases to provide one or more of the Airtime Services to subscribers.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="Numbered-Underline">Airtime Services Availability.
            <p class="Bulleted-List---letters--level-1">(a)&#9;<span class="Underline">Fluctuations and Variations in Speed and Transfer Rates.</span> Given ongoing changes to satellite and terrestrial technologies and fluctuations in usage, accurately predicting daily download and upload data transfer rates is not currently feasible. Published data rates are rate plan maximums and may vary in different regions and conditions. Subscribers will typically experience speeds ship-to-shore that are seventy to eighty percent (70-80%) of the published data rates, although without guarantee. Subscriber acknowledges that, from time to time, the Airtime Services may intermittently encounter variations in data transfer rates because of factors which may include but are not limited to the time of day and congestion on the Internet and/or network as a whole, Subscriber’s own network configuration and usage patterns, and maintenance and upgrade procedures or repairs which KVH and/or its Service Providers, including its satellite operators, may undertake from time to time, including grooming or transition of satellites. </p>
            <p class="Bulleted-List---letters--level-1">(b)&#9;<span class="Underline">Not Error-Free or Continuous.</span> Subscriber further acknowledges that the operation of the Airtime Services may not be continuous, uninterrupted or error-free. Without limiting the foregoing, the Airtime Services may become unavailable or limited because of network equipment failures, capacity limitations of a Service Provider, emergency pre-emption as required by governmental authorities who have jurisdiction over Service Provider’s systems, or periodic or emergency maintenance conducted by KVH or a Service Provider for modifications, upgrades, repairs, and similar purposes. The Airtime Services are also subject to transmission and reception limitations caused by: (a) service area limitations, including without limitation, changes to the satellites used to provide the Airtime Services, or the coverage patterns of the satellites or topographical conditions, whether man-made or natural that obstruct the line of transmission between the Terminal Equipment and the Airtime Services; (b) the condition of Terminal Equipment or Subscriber Equipment; (c) Acts of God and other causes beyond the control of KVH which are not reasonably foreseeable by KVH; (d) weather conditions; (e) atmospheric conditions (i.e., space debris, solar flares, and other atmospheric anomalies or disturbances); (f) magnetic interference; (g) environmental conditions; and (h) other like conditions. Given these limitations, Subscriber is solely responsible for management of its Subscriber data, including but not limited to back-up and restoration of that data. KVH and its Service Providers are not responsible for the loss of Subscriber data or for the back-up or restoration of Subscriber data.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="Numbered-Underline">Security; Passwords.
            <p class="Basic-Paragraph">The Internet is an inherently insecure medium and KVH does not represent, warrant or guarantee the security or integrity of any communications made or received using the Airtime Services. Subscriber shall be solely responsible and liable for the security, confidentiality and integrity of all messages and the Content that Subscriber or its Third Party Users receive, transmit through the Airtime Services or store on the Terminal Equipment. Subscriber shall be solely responsible and liable for any authorized or unauthorized access to Subscriber’s account by any person. Subscriber agrees to bear all responsibility and liability for the confidentiality of the passwords of Subscriber and its Third Party Users and all use of the Airtime Services with such passwords.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="Numbered-Underline">Internet, Programming, and Other Content.
            <p class="Bulleted-List---letters--level-1">(a)&#9;<span class="Underline">Suitability of Content.</span> Subscriber acknowledges that Internet sites, video programming, and other Content, might consist of, include and/or provide access to images, sounds, messages, text, service or other Content and material that may be unsuitable for minors and that may be objectionable to many adults. Subscriber acknowledges that access to the Internet and video programming Content through the Airtime Services is at Subscriber’s sole risk. </p>
            <p class="Bulleted-List---letters--level-1">(b)&#9;<span class="Underline">Limited Availability of Access.</span> The reliability, availability, legality, performance and other aspects of resources accessed through the Internet are beyond KVH’s reasonable control and are not in any way warranted or supported by KVH or its Service Providers. KVH does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from sites or resources available through the Airtime Services, including the accuracy or reliability of any material or claims contained therein. Subscriber acknowledges that safeguards relative to copyright, ownership, appropriateness, reliability, legality and integrity of Content may be entirely lacking with respect to the Internet and Content accessible through it. Subscriber assumes all risk and liability of any use of the Internet through Subscriber’s account. </p>
            <p class="Bulleted-List---letters--level-1">(c)&#9;<span class="Underline">Control of Content.</span> KVH retains absolute and complete discretion to select the programming Content made available by KVH through the Airtime Services, including the right to update, modify, or delete the programming Content that is available through the Airtime Services or is maintained on the Terminal Equipment. KVH may use the Airtime Services to remotely update the programming Content and operating software maintained on the Terminal Equipment without notice to, or the permission of, the Subscriber.

All calls for which KVH receives answer supervision may incur a minimum one-minute charge. KVH relies on answer supervision to determine whether and when a call has been answered. Answer supervision is a signal sent by the carrier connecting the call to indicate the start of call. Answer supervision is generally received when a call is answered; however, answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment. Where no answer supervision is received, KVH may commence billing forty (40) seconds following dial time unless the caller has terminated the call. </p>
